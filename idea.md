## **Application Overview**  
We’re designing an agentic system modeled after a real-world enterprise—with Executive Leadership, layered Management, and specialized Functional Departments. Agents operate autonomously or collaboratively, guided by SOPs and data. A unified dashboard tracks real-time activity and performance, while the Agent Control Panel gives administrators fine-grained control over how agents behave: from fully autonomous to tightly guided.

Control modes include **Autonomous**, **Step‑Through**, and **Human‑in‑the‑Loop**, with **Temporal Controls** to pause, rewind, fast-forward, or branch workflows. The system ensures strategic oversight, operational precision, and continuous learning.

---

### **Executive Leadership**  
- Defines vision, strategic goals, and key success metrics  
- Reviews global KPIs and operational health via live dashboards  
- Approves major SOP changes, resource allocations, and tool integrations  

---

### **Management Layers**  
- Bridge strategy and execution—linking Leadership with Departments  
- Oversee cross-functional coordination and capacity planning  
- Monitor org-level KPIs (throughput, latency, error rate)  
- Handle escalations and ensure alignment with strategic goals  

---

### **Functional Departments**  
Departments like Data, Marketing, Engineering, Sales, etc., house teams of agents who execute tasks using SOPs, tools, and shared data. Agents collaborate or work independently depending on role and context.  

---

### **Continuous Improvement Department**  
- Maintains the centralized library of SOPs, tools, and templates  
- Audits agent behavior, tracks performance, and identifies friction points  
- Runs experiments to refine SOPs, improve toolchains, and train agents  
- Enables agents to evolve SOPs via generational learning loops  

---

### **Agent Control & Interaction**  
**Admin tools to monitor, guide, and refine agent behavior in real time:**  

- **Live Dashboard**  
  - Filterable tables, KPIs, and metrics across departments  
  - Task timelines, decision logs, and performance visualizations  

- **Agent Control Panel**  
  - **Autonomous Mode** – Full hands-off execution  
  - **Step‑Through Mode** – Review each action before approval  
  - **Human‑in‑the‑Loop** – Drop in at any point to intervene, then resume  
  - **Temporal Controls** – Rewind, pause, branch, or fast-forward execution  

---

## **Development Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**  
- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Features:  
  - Unified dashboard and agent control panel  
  - Real-time log streaming and decision-tree visualizer  
  - Modes: Autonomous, Step‑Through, Human‑in‑the‑Loop, and Temporal Controls  

### **Backend**  
- **Node.js + Express.js** for server-side logic and routing  
- **SQLite3** for local storage of agent tasks, SOPs, logs, and audit trails  
- **OpenAI Responses API** for reasoning, decision-making, and task execution
