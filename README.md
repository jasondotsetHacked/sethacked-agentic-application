My plan is to make a general AI agent. Teachable, adaptable, and capable of learning from experience. Primarily for the purposes of employment. The same way a human employee would be onboarded, trained, and then given tasks to do, I want to do the same with an AI agent.

In development of the POC/MVP, I will be using something like the following.

Nodejs
Express
OpenAI API
SQLite
Qdrant

In production, I will be building in the AWS ecosystem.
